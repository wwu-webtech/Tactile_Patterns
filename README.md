# Photo to Tactile Image Map Converter

This is a Western Washington University port of an open source project using the tactile image collaborative project between MLT (Suzana Ilic, John Lau) and Prof. Tune Kamae inorder to create maps out of images that can be printed with tactile paper to help visually impaired folks navigate our campus.

## Goals
The goal of this project is to convert images to [Tactile Images](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactile_graphic) that can be printed with a Tactile Printer on Swell Paper to assist visually impaired people while navigating campus.

## After thermo-printing

Tactily oriented people are testing the tactile patterns representing the original image.
